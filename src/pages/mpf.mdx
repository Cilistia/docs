# Minimum Price Fund

The Minimum Price Fund (MPF) is a mechanism implemented on the Cilistia protocol to ensure that the price of the $CIL token remains above a certain threshold. 10% of all revenue generated on the protocol is added to the MPF, this fund is designed to be used as a last resort to prop up the price of CIL. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How it works

The MPF operates through a smart contract that is triggered when the price of $CIL falls below a certain threshold, T. The smart contract is programmed to release a certain amount of $CIL from the MPF, X, to the market in order to increase the price of CIL. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The amount of $CIL released from the MPF, X, is calculated as follows: {{ className: 'lead' }}

- X = MPF \* (T - P) / P {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Where: {{ className: 'lead' }}
- MPF = the value of the Minimum Price Fund at the time of trigger {{ className: 'lead' }}
- T = the threshold price for $CIL {{ className: 'lead' }}
- P = the current market price for $CIL {{ className: 'lead' }}

This mechanism is designed to be a last resort to prop up the price of $CIL and ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem. The funds in the MPF are held in a transparent and auditable manner and can only be released under specific conditions. {{ className: 'lead' }}
