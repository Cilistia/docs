# Disputes

Cilistia's dispute resolution protocol is designed to provide a transparent, fair and efficient mechanism to resolve disputes that may arise during a trade. The protocol is based on a decentralized system where community members act as arbitrators to review the evidence provided by both parties, and make a decision based on the presented facts. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How it works

In the event of a dispute, both parties are required to submit evidence of their transactions and any relevant communications. This evidence will be hashed and committed to the blockchain for immutability and to make it publicly verifiable. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The community members, who are incentivized to participate in the arbitration process, can then vote on the submitted evidence to determine the outcome of the dispute. The outcome of the vote is then used to determine the distribution of the funds. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The dispute resolution protocol also includes a time-lock mechanism to ensure that the funds are held in escrow until the dispute is resolved. This ensures that the funds are secure and available to be distributed to the winning party. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The protocol is designed to be transparent, fair and efficient, and it ensures that disputes are handled in a decentralized and community-driven manner. The protocol is integrated into the Cilistia ecosystem, and it can be triggered by any user who believes they have been wronged during a trade. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Summary

In summary, Cilistia's dispute resolution protocol is a decentralized mechanism that allows community members to act as arbitrators and review evidence provided by both parties, make a decision based on the presented facts, incentivize the community to participate in the arbitration process, use a time-lock mechanism to ensure that the funds are held in escrow until the dispute is resolved and it's integrated into the Cilistia ecosystem. {{ className: 'lead' }}
