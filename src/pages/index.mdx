# Introduction

Cilistia is the world's first revenue-sharing, decentralized P2P cryptocurrency marketplace that distributes 70% of its revenue to $CIL token stakers. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Cilistia uses smart contracts to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers. When a trade is initiated, a smart contract is created to hold the funds in escrow until both parties agree that the trade has been completed. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This ensures that the funds are secure and cannot be released without the consent of both parties. This also means that there is no need for a third party to act as a mediator or custodian of the funds, as is the case with centralized exchanges. {{ className: 'lead' }}
